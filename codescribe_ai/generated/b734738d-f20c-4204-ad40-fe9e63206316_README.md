## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

Here is a clean, high-level description of the file:

**File: tax_fare_prediction/main.py**

**Main Purpose:** This file is a Flask web application that predicts taxi fares based on user input.

**Key Components:**

* A Flask web application instance to handle HTTP requests and responses
* A pre-trained machine learning model loaded from `model.pkl` using the `pickle` library
* Two routes: `/` and `/predict`
	+ `/`: Renders an `index.html` template with a form for user input
	+ `/predict`: Handles GET and POST requests, makes predictions using the loaded model, and displays results in a `result.html` template

**Key Logic:**

* Assumes numeric user input for temperature, rainfall, holiday, hour, and day of the week
* Uses a try-except block to catch input processing exceptions and returns an error message for invalid input

This code sets up a simple web application that takes user input, makes a prediction using a pre-trained model, and displays the result.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

Here is a clean, high-level description of the `train.py` file:

**Main Purpose:** This file trains a machine learning model to predict taxi fare demand based on historical ride data.

**Key Components:**

The script consists of three main components: data preparation, model training, and model serialization.

**Data Preparation:** The script loads a large CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, converts the `datetime` column to a datetime format, extracts `hour` and `day_of_week` features, and drops unnecessary columns.

**Model Training:** The data is split into training and testing sets, and a `RandomForestRegressor` model is created and fitted to the training data. The model is chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships between features and the target variable.

**Model Serialization:** The trained model and its feature columns are saved to a pickle file for later use in predicting taxi fare demand.

**Key Logic:** The model is trained to predict the `demand` column based on the other features in the dataset.
