## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `config.py`

Here is a clean and high-level description of the `config.py` file:

**Main Purpose:** This file configures and stores sensitive information, specifically an API key, for an application.

**Key Logic:** The file retrieves an environment variable named `API_KEY` using the `os` module and makes it available for use in the application.

**No Functions or Classes:** This file does not define any functions or classes, serving solely as a configuration module to load and provide access to the API key.

In summary, `config.py` is a simple configuration module that loads an API key from an environment variable, making it easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `main.py`

Here is a clean and high-level description of the `main.py` file:

**Main Purpose:** This file serves as an entry point for a Python application, demonstrating the usage of an external utility function.

**Key Components:**

* The file imports and utilizes the `add` function from the `utils` module.
* The script ensures that the code within the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is executed only when run directly, not when imported as a module.
* The `add` function is called with arguments 2 and 3, and the result is printed to the console.

**In summary,** this file showcases how to import and use an external utility function from a separate module, printing the result to the console when run directly.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `utils.py`

Here is a clean, high-level description of the `utils.py` file:

**Main Purpose:** This file provides a utility function for basic arithmetic operations.

**Functions:**

* `add(x, y)`: A simple function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum.

**Key Logic:** The `add` function performs a straightforward addition operation, returning the result of `x + y`.

In essence, this file offers a basic arithmetic utility that can be imported and used elsewhere in the codebase.
