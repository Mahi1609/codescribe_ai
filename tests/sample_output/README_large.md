## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `config.py`

**Summary of config.py**

**Main Purpose:**
The `config.py` file sets an environment variable for an API key, allowing secure storage and management of the key.

**Functions and Classes:**
This file contains a single variable assignment, with no functions or classes defined.

**Key Logic:**
The file imports the `os` module to interact with the operating system, then sets the `API_KEY` environment variable to the value of the `API_KEY` environment variable set in the operating system.

**In Simple Terms:**
This file securely stores and manages a secret API key by retrieving it from the operating system's environment variables, making it easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `main.py`

Here is a clear and concise summary of the `main.py` file:

**Summary of main.py**

**Main Purpose:** This Python script demonstrates the usage of an external utility function `add` from the `utils` module.

**Key Components:**

* The `add` function is imported from `utils` and adds two numbers.
* The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is executed when the script is run directly, printing the result of calling `add` with arguments `2` and `3`.

**Logic:**

1. Import the `add` function from `utils`.
2. Execute the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which calls `add` with `2` and `3`.
3. Print the result to the console.

**Dependence:** This script relies on the `utils` module.

This script is a simple example of using an external utility function from a separate module, showcasing the `add` function's basic arithmetic capabilities.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `utils.py`

Here is a clear and concise summary of the `utils.py` file:

**File Summary:**
The `utils.py` file contains a single, reusable function called `add` that performs basic arithmetic addition.

**Function Summary:**
The `add` function takes two numerical arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. This function is a simple implementation of addition that can be used to combine two numerical values.

**Key Logic:**
The `add` function is a straightforward implementation of addition, where the function takes two inputs, adds them together, and returns the result. The logic is simple and easy to understand, making it a useful utility function for developers to use in their code.

**Technical Insights:**
The `add` function is written in Python and uses the `return` statement to pass the result of the addition back to the caller. This function is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into other code to perform addition operations.

Overall, the `add` function is a simple yet useful utility that can be used to simplify arithmetic operations in Python code.
