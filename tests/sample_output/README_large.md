## üß† Overview
### Code File Summaries

The project appears to be a basic Python application, consisting of three primary source files: `config.py`, `main.py`, and `utils.py`. The `main.py` file serves as the entry point, utilizing the `add` function imported from `utils.py` to perform a simple arithmetic operation. The purpose of this project is uncertain, but it seems to demonstrate a basic modular structure, with `utils.py` providing reusable functions and `main.py` handling execution. Key dependencies and environment variables are not detected, suggesting a self-contained Python project with no external dependencies.

## üîç What Does This Project Do?
This project is designed to ### Code File Summaries

#### PROJECT_PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic Python application structure with utility functions.

#### Key Components
* `config.py`: Not utilized in the provided sample, potentially for configuration settings.
* `main.py`: The entry point of the application, containing the main execution flow.
* `utils.py`: A module providing reusable utility functions, such as the `add` function.

#### Main Functionality
* The `main.py` file imports and uses the `add` function from `utils.py` to perform a simple arithmetic operation.
* When executed, the project prints the result of adding 2 and 3 to the console.

#### Dependencies and Environment
* No external dependencies are detected.
* The project does not appear to rely on any specific framework patterns.

#### Execution
* The project can be executed by running `main.py` directly, although the exact command is not inferred.
* The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures the `print` statement only runs when `main.py` is executed as the main module.

#### Side Effects
* The project prints the result of the `add` function to the console, but does not appear to have any other side effects, such as modifying external state or creating files.

## üß© Code File Summaries

### üìÑ `config.py`
### config.py Summary

The `config.py` file stores configuration settings for the project, specifically loading environment variables.

* **Purpose:** Load environment variables for project configuration.
* **Key Components:** None, utilizes the `os` module for environment variable access.
* **Behavior:**
  * Loads the `API_KEY` from an environment variable.
  * Makes the `API_KEY` variable available for use in other parts of the project.
* **Important Details:**
  * The `API_KEY` variable will be `None` if the environment variable is not set.
  * Relies on external setup of the `API_KEY` environment variable.
* **Security Benefit:** Allows for secure configuration by avoiding hardcoded API keys, making it easier to manage different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).


### üìÑ `main.py`
### main.py Summary

**Purpose:** The `main.py` file serves as the application's entry point, demonstrating the `add` function from the `utils` module.

**Key Components:**
* Imports the `add` function from `utils`
* Uses the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block for direct script execution

**Behavior:**
* Calls `add(2, 3)` and prints the result to the console

**Dependencies:**
* `utils` module, which contains the `add` function implementation

**Notes:**
* To run this script, the `utils` module with the `add` function must be available.
* The exact command to run the script is uncertain without more information about the project structure and environment.


### üìÑ `utils.py`
### utils.py Summary

The `utils.py` file provides a basic arithmetic utility.

* **Purpose**: Simple arithmetic operations.
* **Key Functions**:
  + `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of two input numbers.
* **Inputs/Outputs**:
  + Inputs: Two numbers (`x` and `y`) to be added.
  + Outputs: The sum of `x` and `y`.
* **Side-Effects**: None, with no external state modifications.
* **Dependencies**: None, relying solely on built-in Python functionality.
* **Behavior and Intent**: The `add` function performs a straightforward arithmetic addition, with no error handling or complex logic, making it a simple and lightweight utility for basic calculations.
