* **PROJECT_PURPOSE**: 
  This project appears to be a basic Python application, with its primary purpose being to serve as a starting point or demonstration, as evidenced by the simple "Hello World" output in the `main.py` file.
* **Key Functionality**:
  + The project contains a single source file, `main.py`, which prints a greeting message to the console.
* **Inputs/Outputs**:
  + Inputs: None
  + Outputs: A "Hello World" message printed to the console.
* **Side-Effects**:
  + The project does not appear to have any significant side-effects beyond printing to the console.
* **Dependencies and Frameworks**:
  + None detected, suggesting this is a self-contained Python script.
* **Running the Project**:
  + Uncertain, as the exact method to run the project is not inferred. Typically, a Python project like this could be run using a command like `python main.py` from the project directory, but this is speculative without further context.
