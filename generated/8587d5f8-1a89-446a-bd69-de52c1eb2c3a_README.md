## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

This Python file, `main.py`, sets up a simple web application for predicting taxi fares using a pre-trained machine learning model.

**Key Features:**

- **Flask Web App:**  The application uses Flask to handle user requests and render HTML templates.
- **Model Loading:** It loads a pre-trained model (`model.pkl`) and its corresponding feature names for fare prediction.
- **Prediction Route (`/predict`):**
    - Receives user input from an HTML form.
    - Processes the input data into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Uses the loaded model to predict the taxi fare.
    - Displays the predicted fare in an HTML template (`result.html`).
    - Handles potential errors during input processing or prediction.

**Technology Stack:**

- Flask: Web framework for handling requests and rendering templates.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pickle: Module for loading and saving Python objects (the trained model).

**Purpose:**

The application provides a user-friendly interface for predicting taxi fares based on historical data and a trained machine learning model.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

This Python script trains a machine learning model to predict ride demand. 

**Key Features:**

* **Data Preparation:**  Reads ride data from a CSV file, extracts relevant features (like hour and day of the week), and splits the data into features and the target variable ('demand').
* **Model Training:** Uses a Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees to train a model on the prepared data.
* **Model Saving:**  Saves the trained model and feature names to a file ('model.pkl') for later use.

**Purpose:**  The script aims to build a predictive model for ride demand, which can be used in applications like ride-sharing platform resource allocation.
