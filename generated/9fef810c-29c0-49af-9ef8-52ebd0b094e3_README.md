## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

**Main Purpose:**
The `main.py` file is a Flask web application that predicts taxi fares based on various environmental and temporal factors. It uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions and serves a user-friendly interface to input data and display results.

**Key Logic:**

* The application loads a trained machine learning model and its corresponding feature names from a pickle file (`model.pkl`).
* The `predict()` function extracts input data from the user, converts it to a Pandas DataFrame, and makes a prediction using the trained model.
* If the input data is invalid, the function catches the exception and returns an error message to the user.
* The application serves the `index.html` template as the main entry point and the `result.html` template to display the predicted value.

**Technical Notes:**

* The application uses Flask, a popular Python web framework, to create a web application.
* The `pickle` module is used to load the trained model and feature names from a file.
* The `pandas` library is used to manipulate and analyze data.

**In Summary:**
The `main.py` file is a Flask web application that predicts taxi fares using a trained machine learning model. It loads the model and feature names from a pickle file, extracts input data from the user, makes a prediction, and serves the results through a user-friendly interface.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

Here is a clear and concise summary of the `train.py` file:

**File Summary:**
The `train.py` file is a machine learning script that trains a random forest regressor model to predict taxi fares based on various features.

**Main Purpose:**
The main purpose of this file is to train a machine learning model that can predict taxi fares based on features such as time of day, day of the week, and other relevant factors.

**Key Logic:**

1. The file reads a large CSV file containing ride data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. The DataFrame is cleaned and processed by converting the datetime column into a datetime format, extracting the hour and day of the week, and dropping unnecessary columns.
3. The processed DataFrame is split into training and testing sets.
4. A random forest regressor model is trained using the training set.
5. The trained model is serialized and saved to a file named `model.pkl`.
6. The file also saves the column names of the input features to the pickle file.

**In Summary:**
This file trains a random forest regressor model using a large dataset of ride data and saves the trained model to a file. The model can be used later to make predictions of taxi fares based on various features.

I hope this summary is clear, concise, and useful to a developer!
