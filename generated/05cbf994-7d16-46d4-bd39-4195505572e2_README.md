## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `script.js`

**Overview of script.js**
The `script.js` file manages a simple two-player dice game, handling scoring, player switching, and game state updates based on user interactions.

**Key Components and Logic**

* The game initializes with default scores and an active player.
* The `init` function resets the game state, including scores and the active player.
* The `switchPlayer` function switches the active player, resetting the current score.
* When the "Roll" button is clicked, a random dice roll (1-6) is generated. If the roll is not 1, it adds to the current score; otherwise, it switches to the next player.
* The game ends when a player's score reaches or exceeds 100, at which point the `playing` variable is set to `false`, and the winner is displayed.

**Key Functions**

* `init`: Resets the game state.
* `switchPlayer`: Switches the active player and resets the current score.

**Game Flow**

1. The game starts with an initial state set by the `init` function.
2. The "Roll" button generates a random dice roll, updating the game state.
3. If the roll is 1, the game switches to the next player.
4. The game updates the score display and checks for a winner (score >= 100).
5. If the game ends, the winner is displayed, and the game is set to an inactive state.
