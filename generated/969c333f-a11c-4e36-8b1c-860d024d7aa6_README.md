## üß† Overview
### Code File Summaries

The project is designed to extract invoice fields from PDF files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and a local Ollama Large Language Model (LLM). The main entry point, `main.py`, orchestrates this process by: 
* Extracting text from PDFs via the `ocr_handler` module
* Preprocessing the extracted text using the `text_cleaner` utility
* Sending the cleaned text to the Ollama model for invoice field extraction
* Saving the structured output to a JSON file. 
Key dependencies include custom modules for OCR handling, Ollama model interaction, and text cleaning, with the project relying on standard Python libraries for file system interactions and JSON serialization.

#### PROJECT_PURPOSE
This project is designed to extract invoice fields from PDF files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and a local Ollama Large Language Model (LLM).

#### main.py
**Purpose:** Extract invoice fields from a PDF file using OCR and a local Ollama LLM.
**Key Functions:**
* `main(pdf_path)`: The main entry point of the script, responsible for orchestrating the invoice extraction process.
* `extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)`: Extracts text from a PDF file using OCR (imported from `ocr.ocr_handler`).
* `generate_invoice_fields(cleaned_text)`: Sends the preprocessed text to the local Ollama model to extract structured invoice fields (imported from `llm.ollama_parser`).
* `clean_ocr_text(text)`: Preprocesses the extracted text before sending it to the Ollama model (imported from `utils.text_cleaner`).
**Inputs:**
* `pdf_path`: The path to the PDF file to extract invoice fields from.
**Outputs:**
* A JSON file containing the extracted invoice fields, saved to the "output" directory.
**Side-Effects:**
* Creates the "output" directory if it does not exist.
* Prints various debug messages and previews of the extracted text to the console.
**Dependencies:**
* `os` and `sys` for file system and command-line argument handling.
* `json` for saving the extracted invoice fields to a JSON file.
* `ocr.ocr_handler`, `llm.ollama_parser`, and `utils.text_cleaner` for OCR, LLM, and text preprocessing functionality, respectively.

**How to Run:**
To run the script, save it as `main.py` and execute it from the command line, providing the path to a PDF file as an argument: `python main.py <path_to_pdf>`. The script will extract invoice fields from the PDF file and save the results to a JSON file in the "output" directory.
