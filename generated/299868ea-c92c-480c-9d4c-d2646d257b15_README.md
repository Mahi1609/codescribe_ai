## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

Here is a concise, high-level description of the `main.py` file:

**main.py: Taxi Fare Prediction Web Application**

This Flask web application predicts taxi fares based on environmental and temporal factors using a trained machine learning model. The application loads the model and its feature names from a `model.pkl` file, and uses `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis. The application consists of two routes: `index()` and `predict()`. The `predict()` route handles GET and POST requests, loads form data, makes a prediction using the trained model, and returns the result to the user. The application also includes error handling and template rendering for the `index.html` and `result.html` templates.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

Here is a concise, high-level description of the file:

**File:** `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

**Description:** This Python script trains a machine learning model to predict taxi fares based on historical ride data. It reads ride data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest Regressor model, and saves the trained model to a file.

**Context:** This script is part of a larger project that involves predicting taxi fares using machine learning. The trained model can be used in other scripts to make predictions on new data.

**Key Functionality:** Data preprocessing, model training, and model saving.
