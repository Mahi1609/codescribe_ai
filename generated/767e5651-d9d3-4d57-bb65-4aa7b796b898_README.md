## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Application Overview**

The `main.py` file is a Flask web application that predicts tax fares based on user input parameters. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model loaded from `model.pkl` to make predictions.

**Key Components and Logic:**

* The application has two primary functions: `index` and `predict`.
* `index` renders the `index.html` template, containing a user input form.
* `predict` handles form submissions, extracts input values, creates a Pandas DataFrame, and uses the loaded model to predict the tax fare.
* The predicted fare is displayed in the `result.html` template.

**Logic Flow:**

1. User submits input parameters via the form.
2. `predict` function extracts and converts inputs to numeric values.
3. A DataFrame is created and used for prediction with the loaded model.
4. The predicted tax fare is displayed in `result.html`.
5. Error handling displays error messages in `index.html` if input processing fails.

**Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* `model.pkl` contains a trained model with feature names.
* `index.html` and `result.html` templates are essential for the application's functionality.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Model Training Overview**

The `train.py` file trains a machine learning model to predict taxi demand based on historical ride data. 

**Key Components:**

* Data preparation: loads and preprocesses data from `ride_data_large.csv`
* Feature selection: splits data into input features (`x`) and target variable (`y`)
* Model training: uses `RandomForestRegressor` with 100 estimators
* Model serialization: saves trained model and feature columns to `model.pkl` using Pickle

**Logic Flow:**

1. Load and preprocess data
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train a random forest regressor model
4. Save the trained model and feature columns

This code provides a basic framework for training a demand prediction model, serving as a starting point for further refinement and optimization.
