## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Application Overview**

The `main.py` file is a Flask web application designed to predict tax fares based on environmental and temporal factors. 

**Key Components:**

* **Pre-trained Model**: Loaded from `model.pkl` to make predictions.
* **Routes**: Two main routes - `/` (index) and `/predict` (prediction result).
* **Functions**: 
  * `index`: Renders the `index.html` template.
  * `predict`: Handles form submissions, converts input data into a Pandas DataFrame, and uses the loaded model to make predictions.

**Logic Flow:**

1. User submits form data (temperature, rainfall, holiday, hour, and day of week).
2. `predict` function converts input data into a DataFrame and makes a prediction using the loaded model.
3. Prediction result is rendered in the `result.html` template. If an error occurs, an error message is displayed in the `index.html` template.

**Assumptions:**

* `model.pkl` contains a trained model and feature names.
* `result.html` and `index.html` templates are designed to display the predicted fare and input form, respectively.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Model Training Overview**

The `train.py` file trains a machine learning model to predict taxi demand based on historical ride data. The script consists of the following key components:

* **Data Preparation**: Loads data, converts datetime formats, and extracts relevant features.
* **Feature Selection**: Splits data into input features (`x`) and target variable (`y`, which is `demand`).
* **Model Training**: Trains a `RandomForestRegressor` model on the training data with specified parameters.
* **Model Serialization**: Saves the trained model and feature columns to a file (`model.pkl`) for future use.

The logic flow is as follows:

1. Load and preprocess data.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a random forest regressor model.
4. Save the trained model and feature columns.

This script provides a basic framework for training a taxi demand prediction model using a random forest regressor, allowing for easy deployment and future predictions.
