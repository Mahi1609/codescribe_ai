## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Application Overview**

The `main.py` file is a Flask web application designed to predict tax fares based on user input. 

**Key Components:**

* **Pre-trained Model**: A loaded model (`model.pkl`) is used for predictions.
* **Routes**:
	+ `/`: Renders the `index.html` template.
	+ `/predict`: Handles GET and POST requests, extracts input parameters, and uses the model to make predictions.
* **Prediction Logic**: The `predict` function handles exceptions and returns error messages for invalid input.

**Logic Flow:**

1. Load the pre-trained model.
2. Define application routes.
3. Extract input parameters, create a Pandas DataFrame, and make predictions using the loaded model in the `/predict` route.

**Deployment:**

The application runs in debug mode when executed directly.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Model Training Overview**

The `train.py` file trains a machine learning model to predict taxi demand based on historical ride data. 

**Key Components:**

* Data preparation: Loads `ride_data_large.csv` into a pandas DataFrame, converting the `datetime` column and extracting features like `hour` and `day_of_week`.
* Data split: Splits data into training (`x_train`, `y_train`) and testing sets (`x_test`, `y_test`) using `train_test_split`.
* Model training: Trains a `RandomForestRegressor` model on the training data with 100 estimators.
* Model serialization: Saves the trained model and feature columns to a `model.pkl` file.

**Logic Flow:**

1. Load and preprocess data.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a `RandomForestRegressor` model.
4. Save the trained model to a pickle file.

This script provides a basic framework for training a taxi demand prediction model using a random forest regressor.
