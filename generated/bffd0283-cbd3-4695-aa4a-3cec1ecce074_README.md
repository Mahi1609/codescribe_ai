## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

This Python file sets up a simple web application using Flask to predict taxi fares. 

**Functionality:**

The application loads a pre-trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`) to predict fares based on ride conditions. Users can input factors like temperature, rainfall, holiday, hour, and day of the week through a web form. The application processes this data, uses the model for prediction, and displays the result to the user.

**Key Components:**

* **Flask Web App:**  The core of the application is built using Flask, handling routing and user interactions.
* **Model Loading:**  A pre-trained machine learning model is loaded from a file (`model.pkl`) using `pickle`.
* **Routes:**
    * `/`: Displays the main web page (`index.html`).
    * `/predict`: Handles fare prediction requests (GET and POST).
* **Prediction Logic:**
    * Extracts input data from the web form.
    * Prepares the data into a suitable format for the model.
    * Uses the loaded model to predict the fare.
    * Handles potential errors during input processing.
    * Displays the predicted fare using a template (`result.html`).

**Running the App:**

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block starts the Flask development server, allowing you to test and interact with the application.



This summary provides a clear understanding of the file's purpose, key components, and how it works.

## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

This Python script trains a machine learning model to predict ride demand. 

**Key Functionality:**

* **Data Preparation:** Loads ride data from a CSV file, extracts relevant features (like hour and day of the week), and prepares the data for training.
* **Model Training:** Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees to build a predictive model. The model is trained on a portion of the prepared data.
* **Model Saving:** Saves the trained model and a list of used features to a file ("model.pkl") for later reuse.

**Purpose:**

The script aims to create a reusable model for predicting ride demand, which can be valuable for ride-sharing services or transportation planning.
