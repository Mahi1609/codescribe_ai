## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Application Overview**

The `main.py` file is a Flask web application that predicts tax fares based on input parameters. It utilizes a pre-trained model loaded from `model.pkl` to make predictions.

**Key Components and Logic:**

* The application loads a pre-trained model and feature names from `model.pkl`.
* The `predict` function handles GET and POST requests, retrieving input data from an HTML form and using it to make predictions.
* Input data is used to create a Pandas DataFrame, which is passed to the pre-trained model for prediction.
* Predictions are rendered on the `result.html` page, while errors are displayed on the `index.html` page.

**Functions:**

* `index`: Renders the `index.html` page.
* `predict`: Handles requests, makes predictions, and renders the `result.html` page.

This application provides a simple web interface for predicting tax fares based on various input parameters, leveraging a pre-trained model for accurate predictions.

### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

**Tax Fare Prediction Model Training**

The `train.py` file trains a machine learning model to predict taxi demand based on historical ride data. 

**Key Components:**

* **Data Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses ride data, extracting features like `hour` and `day_of_week`.
* **Model Training**: Trains a `RandomForestRegressor` model on the training data with 100 estimators.
* **Model Serialization**: Saves the trained model and feature columns to a file (`model.pkl`) for future use.

**Logic Flow:**

1. Load and preprocess data.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a random forest regressor model.
4. Save the trained model.

This script provides a basic framework for training a taxi demand prediction model using a random forest regressor.
