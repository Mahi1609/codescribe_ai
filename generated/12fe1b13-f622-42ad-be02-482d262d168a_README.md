## 🧩 Code File Summaries
### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/main.py`

This Python file `main.py` implements a simple web application for predicting taxi fares using a pre-trained machine learning model. 

**Key Features:**

* **Flask Framework:**  The application leverages the Flask framework to handle web requests and routing.
* **Model Loading:** It loads a saved machine learning model (`model.pkl`) along with its feature names (`feature_names`). This model was likely trained to predict taxi fares based on various factors.
* **Routes:**
    * `/`:  Serves an HTML template (`index.html`) that likely contains a form for user input.
    * `/predict`:  Processes user-submitted data (temperature, rainfall, holiday, hour, day of week) through the loaded model to generate a fare prediction. The result is displayed in an HTML template (`result.html`).
* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to manage invalid input types.

**Workflow:**

1. The Flask app initializes and loads the pre-trained model.
2. When a user submits data through the `/predict` route:
   - The input is parsed and formatted into a suitable format for the model.
   - The model predicts the fare based on the input data.
   - The prediction is presented to the user via the `result.html` template.



In summary, this file sets up a web-based tool for predicting taxi fares using a pre-trained machine learning model.

### 📄 `tax_fare_prediction/train.py`

This Python script, `train.py`, trains a Random Forest model to predict ride demand. 

**Here's what it does:**

1. **Loads and Prepares Data:** It reads ride data from a CSV file, extracts relevant features like day of week and hour, and removes unnecessary columns.

2. **Splits Data:** It divides the data into features (X) and the target variable (ride demand, Y), and then splits it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

3. **Trains the Model:** It creates a Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees and trains it on the training data.

4. **Saves the Model:** It saves the trained model and a list of feature names to a file ("model.pkl") for later use.

Essentially, this script prepares data, trains a predictive model, and saves it for future use in making ride demand predictions.
